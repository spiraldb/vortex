//! A type system for Vortex.
//!
//! This crate contains the core logical type system for Vortex, including the definition of data types,
//! and (optionally) logic for their serialization and deserialization.
//!
//! Vortex dtypes are logical domains, not physical layouts. Encodings are tracked separately on
//! arrays, so the same dtype may be backed by canonical buffers, dictionary codes, compressed
//! children, or a lazy expression array.
//!
//! Every non-null logical dtype carries [`Nullability`] directly. This differs from Apache Arrow,
//! where nullability is usually field metadata.

/// The logical types of elements in Vortex arrays.
///
/// `DType` represents the different logical data types that can be represented in a Vortex array.
///
/// This is different from physical types, which represent the actual layout of data (compressed or
/// uncompressed). The set of physical types/formats (or data layout) is surjective into the set of
/// logical types (or in other words, all physical types map to a single logical type).
///
/// Note that a `DType` represents the logical type of the elements in the `Array`s, **not** the
/// logical type of the `Array` itself.
///
/// For example, an array with [`DType::Primitive`]([`I32`], [`NonNullable`]) could be physically
/// encoded as any of the following:
///
/// - A flat array of `i32` values.
/// - A run-length encoded sequence.
/// - Dictionary encoded values with bitpacked codes.
///
/// All of these physical encodings preserve the same logical [`I32`] type, even if the physical
/// data is different.
///
/// [`I32`]: PType::I32
/// [`NonNullable`]: Nullability::NonNullable
