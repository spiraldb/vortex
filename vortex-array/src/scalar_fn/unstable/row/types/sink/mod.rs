/// A column allocated once per batch that a row closure writes into, one row at a time.
///
/// A sink owns batch-wide state that an independent owned value cannot express, such as
/// uninitialized storage or a row handle covering more than one element. The executor passes each
/// row slot into an [`Fn`] closure.
///
/// A sink describes only how rows are physically written. An output dtype derived from the
/// function options or argument dtypes is declared by [`RowVisitor::with_output_dtype`], which
/// labels the column this sink builds.
///
/// Rows arrive in increasing index order. Ordinary execution visits `0..row_count` exactly once.
/// Execution can omit invalid rows when [`skipped_rows_initializer`] returns an initializer.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Lifecycle methods report only incidental failures such as allocation. A semantic error that
/// depends on input values **must** come from the row callback through a fallible [`SinkResult`],
/// or [`RowFn::INFALLIBLE`] cannot protect optimizations such as dictionary push-down.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// An implementation must uphold all of these requirements:
///
/// - Every index below [`ViewLen::len`] for [`Rows`] **must** identify one distinct row owned by
///   this sink.
/// - A borrowed [`Rows`] view **must** retain its length and index-to-row mapping until it is
///   dropped. Calls to [`row_unchecked`](Self::row_unchecked) and safe uses of a returned
///   [`Row`](Self::Row) **must** preserve both properties.
/// - [`skipped_rows_initializer`] is the only exception to this stability requirement. The executor
///   checks the length again after the initializer. The initializer **must** initialize every row.
/// - A row must either be initialized before the callback or require a
///   [`WriteToken`] that safe code cannot produce without initializing that exact row. Evidence for
///   an uninitialized row **must not** be safely forgeable, reusable, or substitutable.
/// - `Self` and every borrowed [`Rows`] view **must** remain safe to drop if decoding,
///   preparation, skipped-row initialization, or a row callback returns an error or unwinds. The
///   executor can abandon a sink after any prefix of rows.
/// - [`finish`] **must** be sound once every visited callback returned its required token and the
///   skipped-row initializer, when present, ran successfully.
/// - Violating these requirements can cause undefined behavior.
