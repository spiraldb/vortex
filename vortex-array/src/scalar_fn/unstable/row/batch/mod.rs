//! Batch execution for a strict row function.
//!
//! A batch is the set of same-length input columns supplied in one scalar-function call. A row
//! function handles typed values for one logical row. This module adds the columnar concerns around
//! that row function: planning the output and null handling, preserving batch constants,
//! propagating strict validity, selecting an execution strategy, and validating the finished
//! output.
//!
//! [`BatchPlan`] carries the nullable execution strategy selected by a concrete dispatch.
//! [`RowFnExecutionArgs`] applies that strategy, and [`BorrowedRowFnArgs`] pairs each kernel
//! invocation with its planning metadata.
