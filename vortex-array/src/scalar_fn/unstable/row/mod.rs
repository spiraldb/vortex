//! Experimental support for strict scalar functions computed one row at a time.
//!
//! This module is experimental and has no compatibility guarantees. External users must enable
//! the `unstable_row_fns` Cargo feature before importing it.
//!
//! A [`RowFn`] describes the typed operation while the framework owns columnar concerns such as
//! decoding, constant handling, null propagation, allocation, and validity. Its
//! [`RowFn::dispatch`] implementation uses a [`RowVisitor`] to select an [`ElementTuple`] and
//! either an [`OutputElement`] or [`OutputSink`] for each supported dtype combination.
//!
//! Unlike a general strict function, a [`RowFn`] cannot produce null from valid inputs.
//!
//! A _partially valid_ batch contains both valid and invalid rows. _Skip-invalid_ runs the kernel
//! only for valid rows without changing row positions.
//!
//! Prepared visits move work derived from constant operands outside the hot loop. Deferred visits
//! reduce compact failure evidence without constructing errors in that loop. Eligible kernels
//! first evaluate all payloads. If the reduced evidence reports an error for a partially valid
//! batch, execution retries only valid rows.
