//! Definitions of Vortex *editions*: named sets of serialized component IDs. Frozen editions
//! carry a forever read-compatibility guarantee; draft editions do not.
//!
//! Editions live on the session, like encodings do: [`EditionSession`] holds the registered
//! editions and [`EnabledEditions`] selects which of them a writer may emit. Declarations
//! are plain constants — an [`EditionId`] plus an [`Edition`] record, and one
//! [`EditionInclusion`] per member stating that it is a member of an edition *and every
//! later edition of the same family*. Any crate can register declarations into a session,
//! so inclusions can live next to the component they describe.
//!
//! Every membership is typed by a [`ComponentKind`], and members are resolved one kind at a
//! time with [`EditionSessionExt::enabled_component_ids`]: the file writer restricts the
//! arrays, layouts, extension dtypes, and aggregates it writes from separate id sets. Array
//! memberships name wire IDs rather than in-memory array representations. An array plugin may
//! serialize one current in-memory representation under several historical IDs. The serialization
//! context validates the ID chosen by the plugin before writing it. Readers resolve the ID stored
//! in the file and either deserialize it into the current representation or reject it as unknown.
//!
//! An edition is represented as a **draft** until its [`Edition::min_library_version`] is
//! recorded. A stable edition may freeze in the release that cuts it; once that release version
//! is known, the field is backfilled to document the freeze. The per-edition member sets are
//! computed from the registered declarations by [`EditionSession::components_in`], and
//! correctness is enforced by unit tests: [`EditionSession::validate`] checks a whole registry,
//! and [`test_harness::validate_edition`] validates one edition's constraints — call it once in
//! the `#[cfg(test)]` module of each edition definition.
//!
//! The first-party edition declarations live in this crate. The public `vortex` crate
//! re-exports them and registers and enables them on the default session. See the published spec at
//! <https://docs.vortex.dev/specs/editions.html>.
