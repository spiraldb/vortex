/// A single compression encoding that the [`CascadingCompressor`] can select from.
///
/// The compressor evaluates every registered scheme whose [`matches`] returns `true` for a given
/// array, picks the one with the highest [`expected_compression_ratio`], and calls [`compress`] on
/// the winner.
///
/// One of the key features of the compressor in this crate is that schemes may "cascade". A
/// scheme's [`compress`] can call back into the compressor via
/// [`CascadingCompressor::compress_child`] to compress child or transformed arrays, building up
/// multiple encoding layers (e.g. frame-of-reference and then bit-packing).
///
/// # Scheme IDs
///
/// Every scheme has a globally unique name returned by [`scheme_name`]. The [`SchemeExt::id`]
/// method (auto-implemented, cannot be overridden) wraps that name in an opaque [`SchemeId`] used
/// for equality, hashing, and exclusion rules (see below).
///
/// # Cascading and children
///
/// Schemes that produce child arrays for further compression must declare [`num_children`] > 0.
/// Each child should be identified by a stable index. Cascading schemes should use
/// [`CascadingCompressor::compress_child`] to compress each child array, which handles cascade
/// level / budget tracking and context management automatically.
///
/// No scheme may appear twice in a cascade (descendant) chain (enforced by the compressor). This
/// keeps the search space a tree.
///
/// # Exclusion rules
///
/// Schemes declare exclusion rules to prevent incompatible scheme combinations in the cascade
/// chain:
///
/// - [`descendant_exclusions`] (push): "exclude scheme X from my child Y's subtree." Used when the
///   declaring scheme knows about the excluded scheme.
/// - [`ancestor_exclusions`] (pull): "exclude me if ancestor X's child Y is above me." Used when
///   the declaring scheme knows about the ancestor.
///
/// We do this because different schemes will live in different crates, and we cannot know the
/// dependency direction ahead of time.
///
/// # Implementing a scheme
///
/// [`expected_compression_ratio`] should return
/// `CompressionEstimate::Deferred(DeferredEstimate::Sample)` when a cheap heuristic is not
/// available, asking the compressor to estimate via sampling. Implementors should return an
/// immediate [`CompressionEstimate::Verdict`] when possible.
///
/// Schemes that need statistics that may be expensive to compute should override [`stats_options`]
/// to declare what they require. The compressor merges all eligible schemes' options before
/// generating stats, so each stat is always computed at most once for a given array.
///
/// A scheme implementation should be deterministic for a fixed input array and context. The
/// compressor uses scheme order for deterministic tie-breaking, so non-deterministic estimates make
/// compressed output harder to reproduce and compare.
