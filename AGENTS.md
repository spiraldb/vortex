# AGENTS.md

Guidance for Claude, Codex and other coding agents working in the Vortex repository.

## Task Routing

- When asked to investigate a CI failure, especially via `/ci-failure-analysis`, use the
  `.agents/skills/ci-failure-analysis` skill. It is the source of truth for fetching logs,
  classifying failures, and attributing causation.

## Overview

Vortex is a Rust monorepo for columnar array processing, compression encodings, and file IO.
The workspace also contains Java bindings in `java/`, Python bindings in `vortex-python/`,
documentation in `docs/`, and benchmark tooling in `vortex-bench/` and `benchmarks/`.

## Repository Layout

- `vortex-bytes` owns memory and nothing else: `Alignment`, plus the untyped `SharedBytes` and
  `UniqueBytes` windows into reference-counted regions, each carrying the alignment it promises
  and the alignment it grows with. All of the allocation `unsafe` lives here, non-generic so it
  compiles once. It has no dependencies, including on `vortex-error`; `vortex-error` converts its
  `InvalidAlignment` behind a `vortex-bytes` feature.
- `vortex-buffer` defines zero-copy aligned `Buffer<T>` and `BufferMut<T>`: typed views over
  `vortex-bytes` windows, guaranteed to be aligned to `T` or to a requested runtime alignment.
  Zero-sized `T` is rejected at compile time.
- `vortex-array/src/dtype` contains the `DType` logical type system used throughout Vortex.
- `vortex-array` contains the core `Array` trait and the base encodings, including most
  Apache Arrow-style encodings.
- `encodings/*` contains more specialized compressed encodings.
- `vortex-file` implements file IO. It uses `LayoutReader` from `vortex-layout`.
- `vortex-io` holds the core async and blocking IO traits, plus the generic `object_store`
  adapters that implement them.
- `vortex-cloud` holds the cloud object store integration: the URL-to-`ObjectStore` registry
  and the OpenDAL-backed services (`cos://`, `oss://`). Every binding resolves URLs through it.
- `vortex-scan`, `vortex-session`, `vortex-datafusion`, and `vortex-duckdb` contain scan
  and execution integrations.
- `vortex-python` contains Python bindings. RST-flavored project docs live in `docs/`.

## Scoped Guidance

Before changing files in a subtree, read the closest nested `AGENTS.md`. In particular:

- `.github/AGENTS.md` covers workflows and other GitHub configuration.
- `docs/AGENTS.md` covers Sphinx documentation.

## Verification

Linting, formatting, testing, builds, benchmarks, and other verification commands are optional.
Users decide which checks to run and when. Do not run them automatically or make task completion
depend on them. The commands below, and verification commands in scoped guidance or contributor
workflows, are reference instructions for when the user requests a check.

When verification is requested, use the narrowest check that covers the relevant changes. CI
already runs workspace-wide checks. Markdown, RST, Sphinx configuration, agent configuration,
comments outside Rust code, symlinks, and other metadata with no Rust/API behavior impact do not
need Rust checks. Targeted doc/config commands or path inspection with `ls`, `find`, and
`git status` are available for those changes.

### Rust

For requested Rust linting and formatting, scope these commands to the affected crate:

```bash
cargo clippy -p <crate-name> --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo +nightly-<pinned> fmt -p <crate-name>
```

To match CI when running these commands:

- Include `-D warnings` so clippy fails on the warnings that CI rejects.
- Use the nightly pinned as `NIGHTLY_TOOLCHAIN` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. A floating
  `+nightly` can format differently from the toolchain CI checks against, so the reformatted tree
  still fails `fmt --check`.

There is no separate build step: `cargo clippy --all-targets` compiles the crate.

When the user wants Rust tests, scope them to the affected crate. Doctests cover Rust doc comments
and crate documentation:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p <crate-name>
cargo test --doc -p <crate-name>
```

If needed for a requested test run, install cargo-nextest with `cargo install --locked cargo-nextest`.

### Python

The following applies to Python bindings and their PyO3 implementation under `vortex-python/`,
and to CUDA bindings under `vortex-python-cuda/`. These commands use the repository root as their
working directory.

Follow the [Python binding development workflow](CONTRIBUTING.md#python-bindings) for environment
setup, Maturin rebuilds, targeted testing, Cargo features, and the full Python check. Keep the
contributor guide as the source of truth for shared commands; its verification workflows are
available when the user chooses to run them.

Python linting, formatting, and type-checking commands:

```bash
uvx ruff format --check <changed-python-files>
uvx ruff check <changed-python-files>
uvx ty check vortex-python vortex-python-cuda vortex-ffi/cmake/tests scripts/tests
```

Use `uvx` for both Ruff and ty, matching CI. The command above covers both binding packages and the
CMake and script tests. For a narrower check, pass the affected directory, such as
`uvx ty check vortex-python` or `uvx ty check vortex-ffi/cmake/tests`. Checking the whole binding
package covers callers affected by stub or annotation changes.

ty reads Python sources and stubs and needs third-party dependencies for type information.
`uv sync --all-packages --no-install-workspace` prepares those dependencies without building the
Rust extensions. Runtime tests still need the installed extensions.

Use targeted `# ty: ignore[rule-name]` comments for intentional violations, such as invalid-input
tests or third-party stub limitations, and explain non-obvious suppressions. Pyright suppression
comments do not suppress ty diagnostics. Keep shared ty configuration in the root `pyproject.toml`.

Functions that only return `None`, including tests, may omit the `-> None` annotation. ty does not
require return annotations, and Ruff's `suppress-none-returning` setting permits omitting them for
these functions. Bare `return` and falling through are also allowed when the
return type permits `None`; Ruff's `RET502` and `RET503` rules are explicitly disabled.

When the user wants Python tests, run the targeted suite with:

```bash
uv run --all-packages pytest <changed-python-tests>
```

For Python docstrings, `docs/api/python/`, or Sphinx configuration changes, follow
`docs/AGENTS.md`; the contributor guide documents clean Sphinx builds and doctests. All verification
remains the user's choice. The Rust commands above cover PyO3 files when scoped to the affected
binding crate (`-p vortex-python` or `-p vortex-python-cuda`).

`git diff --check` is available for checking patch whitespace.

### C++ and CUDA

For requested formatting of `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.cu`, `.cuh`, and `.h` files under `lang/cpp`,
`vortex-cuda`, `vortex-duckdb`, and `vortex-ffi`, use the repository's `.clang-format` configuration:

```bash
clang-format --style=file -i <changed-files>
```

Pass only the files you changed; CI excludes vendored or generated CUDA and Arrow headers from its
repository-wide check. clang-format is idempotent, so a `--dry-run --Werror` pass over the files
you just formatted cannot fail and is not worth running.

When the user wants CMake integration tests, CI runs the Python unittest suite with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s vortex-ffi/cmake/tests -v
```

These tests need CMake, Ninja, the C/C++ and Rust toolchains, and the lockfile-selected Cargo
dependencies cached by `cargo fetch --locked`.

### New and generated files

These CI checks are the ones most often missed when adding files rather than editing them:

- Every source file needs SPDX headers, in the comment syntax of its language:

  ```text
  SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright the Vortex contributors
  ```

  `REUSE.toml` records the exceptions, including the CC-BY-4.0 licensing of `docs/**`.

- Spelling is checked by `typos` against `_typos.toml`.
- CI asserts `git status --porcelain` is empty after a build. Regenerate generated files with the
  repository's tooling rather than editing them by hand, and commit the result.

### Notes

- For `.github/` changes, follow `.github/AGENTS.md`, which covers both the yamllint invocation and
  the nightly toolchain pin.
- If cargo fails with exactly `sccache: error: Operation not permitted`, rerun that command
  with `RUSTC_WRAPPER=` so rustc runs directly. Only do this for that exact error.

## Rust Code Style

- Follow `STYLE.md` for Rust formatting, documentation, API, error-handling, import, safety, and
  performance conventions. Its hidden-cost accessor table is the reference for changes to
  per-element loops; back such changes with the benchmarks it names.
- Only write comments that explain non-obvious logic or important context. Do not comment
  self-explanatory code.

## Tests

- Strongly consider `rstest` cases when parameterizing repetitive test logic.
- Prefer test functions that return `VortexResult<()>` and use `?` instead of `unwrap`.
- Prefer test module names `tests`, not `test`.
- Use `assert_arrays_eq!` for array comparisons instead of element-by-element assertions.
- Keep tests concise and focused on behavior, edge cases, and regressions.
- If a bug fix is requested, add or identify a regression test when practical. Leave execution
  to the user; when tests are run, a test that passes before and after the fix does not prove it.
- If clippy lints in tests prohibit patterns that are acceptable only in test code, consider
  allowing the lint at the test module level.
- If an existing `foo.rs` module needs many tests, promote it to a directory module:
  `foo/mod.rs` plus `foo/tests.rs`, included from `foo/mod.rs` behind the appropriate test
  configuration.

## Common Mistakes

Check new and modified lines against this list before finishing:

- Adding imports inside functions when module-level imports would work.
- Updating expected test output to match buggy behavior without independently verifying the
  intended semantics.
- Silently reducing the scope of an approved plan when implementation is harder than expected.

## Summaries

When summarizing work, write valid Markdown that can be copied into GitHub. Include the checks
you ran and call out any checks you could not run.

## Branches

When creating a branch on the user's behalf, prefix its name with the user's established branch
prefix, not the agent's name (for example, do not use `codex/` or `claude/`). Infer the user's
prefix from their existing branches when possible. Otherwise, use available identity context such
as `whoami`, Git configuration, or other information the user has provided. If the evidence is
ambiguous, ask the user instead of inventing a prefix.

## Commits

All commits must be signed off by the committers in this form:

```text
Signed-off-by: "COMMITTER" <COMMITTER_EMAIL>
```
