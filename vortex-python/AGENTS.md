# Python Binding Guidance

Applies to the Python bindings and their PyO3 implementation under `vortex-python/`.

Run the commands below from the repository root.

## Build and Development

Follow the [Python binding development workflow](../CONTRIBUTING.md#python-bindings) in the
contributor guide for environment setup, Maturin rebuilds, targeted testing, Cargo features, and
the full Python check. Keep the contributor guide as the source of truth for shared commands.

## Testing

Run the narrow checks that match the files changed before broader Python suites:

```bash
python -m py_compile <changed-python-files>
uv run --all-packages pytest <changed-python-tests>
```

If Python docstrings, `docs/api/python/`, or Sphinx configuration change, also follow
`docs/AGENTS.md` and run the relevant clean Sphinx checks.

## Linting and Formatting

```bash
uv run ty check vortex-python
uv run ruff format --check <changed-python-files>
uv run ruff check <changed-python-files>
```

If PyO3 Rust files under `vortex-python/src/` change, include:

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt --check -p vortex-python
```

Always finish Python binding work with `git diff --check`.
