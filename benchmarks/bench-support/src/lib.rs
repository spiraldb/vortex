/// Takes no argument: the benchmark runs on all of them. Write it *above* `#[divan::bench]`,
/// whose arguments it fills in — the name is qualified with the leg that produced it, both as
/// a `::` component the CI filter selects on and as a suffix on the leaf name CodSpeed
/// reports under, so the legs report one series each rather than fighting over a shared name.
/// `ignore` takes the benchmark out of the sharded simulation job. A plain `cargo bench` runs
/// it as before, under its bare name.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[vortex_bench_support::cpu_features]
/// #[divan::bench(args = INPUT_SIZE, sample_size = 256)]
/// fn words_gather_dispatch(bencher: Bencher, len: usize) { /* ... */ }
/// ```
///
/// `sample_size` is required: it is how many times one sample runs the benchmark, and the
/// number reported is the sample's time divided by it. The runner brackets every sample with
/// its own hooks and timestamps, and what that costs the sample that follows is a fixed
/// amount that differs from one host to the next by about a microsecond. Left to itself,
/// divan sizes samples by its first, cold run and settles on one iteration for anything over
/// a few microseconds, so on a bad host every case in a binary read the same ~1.2 µs slower
/// regardless of its length. Pick the size so that a sample lasts at least ~100 µs on the
/// smallest argument: 64 for a 2 µs case, 16 for a 10 µs one, 4 for 50 µs. When the arguments
/// span a wide range, add `sample_count` below the default of 1,000 so the largest one does
/// not take seconds.
///
/// A larger sample changes what divan keeps alive: it builds a sample's `with_inputs` up
/// front and holds its outputs until the sample ends, so with `sample_size` of each in
/// flight, an input built per iteration or an output of any size is written to cold memory
/// instead of a block the allocator just recycled. Build inputs once, and drop a large output
/// inside the closure with `divan::black_box_drop` rather than returning it.
///
/// Spell it out in full rather than importing it: benchmark files are read a function at a
/// time, and the path says where the behaviour comes from. The binary's `fn main` carries
/// [`main`], which the walltime legs need for a repeatable layout.
///
/// This is for code that is written once and *compiled* differently per feature set — a
/// shipped entry point that selects its kernel through `cfg(target_feature)`, or a scalar
/// loop whose auto-vectorization depends on the build. A hand-written kernel for one
/// instruction set extension is a different thing: it cannot run on the other legs, so it
/// does not belong here. Keep those on `#[cfg(not(codspeed))]` for local A/B runs.
