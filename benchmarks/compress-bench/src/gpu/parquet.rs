//! GPU Parquet decompression backend, timed through cuDF.
//!
//! cuDF's `read_parquet` performs the whole read on the device — page header decode,
//! codec decompression, dictionary/RLE/plain decoding and column assembly — which makes it
//! the like-for-like opponent for the Vortex GPU backend, which likewise decodes all the way
//! to canonical arrays on device.
//!
//! cuDF has no Rust binding, so this backend drives it out of process: it spawns `python3`
//! running [`CUDF_SCRIPT`], which imports cuDF from the prebuilt `cudf-cu12` Python package
//! and prints its timings back as JSON on stdout. Nothing here links against libcudf, so cuDF
//! is a runtime requirement of the benchmark rather than a Rust build dependency — see the
//! README for the install.
//!
//! The clock lives inside that script, not around the subprocess, so process spawn,
//! interpreter start, `import cudf` and CUDA context creation are all excluded; only the reads
//! themselves are timed.
