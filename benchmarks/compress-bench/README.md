# Compression benchmark

Measures compression and decompression throughput, plus resulting file sizes, for Vortex,
Parquet, uncompressed Arrow IPC, and optionally Lance.

[Arrow IPC](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format) is Apache
Arrow's built-in file format, formerly called Feather V2. This suite writes it without
optional buffer compression. Its timings therefore isolate serialization and deserialization
without codec cost. Its file size provides the approximately 1x baseline for compression
ratios. Parquet provides the established reference for a compressed columnar representation.

The suite covers NYC taxi data and several
[Public BI](https://github.com/cwida/public_bi_benchmark) tables (Arade, Bimbo,
CMSprovider, Euro2016, Food, HashTags), TPC-H `l_comment` variants, and synthetic nested
data. This is the workload behind the `Compression` PR comment.

See [`src/main.rs`](./src/main.rs) for the dataset list and CLI flags (`--formats`,
`--datasets`, `--ops compress,decompress`).

## Running locally

```bash
cargo run -p compress-bench --profile release_debug
```

## GPU decompression

`--gpu-decompress` is opt-in, requires the `cuda` feature, and restricts the suite to the
GPU dataset list in `src/main.rs`. It measures decompression only, for two backends:

- **Vortex** — the file is written with CUDA-compatible BtrBlocks encodings only
  (`only_cuda_compatible`) and a CUDA flat layout, then decoded on the device all the way to
  canonical arrays.
- **Parquet** — the file is rewritten with GPU-friendly writer settings (see below) and read
  back with [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)'s `read_parquet`, which performs the
  whole read on the device: page header decode, codec decompression, dictionary/RLE/plain
  decoding and column assembly.

Both sides therefore decode all the way to device-resident arrays, which is what makes the
`vortex:parquet-<codec> gpu ratio decompress time` metric a like-for-like comparison.

```bash
cargo run -p compress-bench --profile release_debug \
  --features cuda,unstable_encodings -- --gpu-decompress

# pick the Parquet page codec the GPU file is written with (default: snappy)
cargo run -p compress-bench --profile release_debug \
  --features cuda,unstable_encodings -- --gpu-decompress --gpu-parquet-codec zstd
```

### cuDF

cuDF has no Rust binding, so the benchmark drives it out of process: it spawns `python3` running
`scripts/cudf-parquet-read.py`, which imports cuDF from the prebuilt `cudf-cu12` Python package,
reads the file, and prints its timings back as JSON on stdout. Nothing links against libcudf, so
cuDF is a runtime requirement rather than a Rust build dependency:

```bash
uv pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com cudf-cu12 pandas pyarrow
```

The clock lives inside that script rather than around the subprocess, so process spawn,
interpreter start, `import cudf` and CUDA context creation are all excluded; a warm-up read runs
first for the same reason. The script performs several timed reads per invocation and reports the
fastest, and the harness then takes its own minimum across `--iterations`.

Both backends read a warm file by default. cuDF runs an untimed warm-up read before the timed
one, so its timed read hits the page cache; the Vortex reader therefore does **not** use direct
I/O by default, because `O_DIRECT` would bypass the page cache and compare a Vortex read of the
disk against a cuDF read of RAM. `--gpu-direct-io` turns it back on to measure storage bandwidth
instead — a different question, and the resulting ratio is not a decode comparison.

The remaining asymmetry is the transfer path: the Vortex reader uses pinned buffers, while cuDF
does its own host read and host-to-device copy.

### GPU-friendly Parquet writer settings

Set in `src/gpu/writer.rs`:

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| writer version | `PARQUET_1_0` | v1 pages compress the whole page body; v2 pages put uncompressed levels ahead of the compressed values in the same body. |
| compression | Snappy (default) or Zstd | Snappy is the Parquet default and has the higher device-side throughput. |
| dictionary | enabled | Keeps the decompressed payload small; the encoding GPU Parquet readers decode fastest. |
| data page size | 1 MiB | Large enough to amortize per-page setup, small enough to keep every SM fed. Matches the page size cuDF targets. |
| data page row limit | 1,000,000 | The 20k-row default caps narrow columns' pages far below 1 MiB. |
| statistics | chunk-level | Page statistics only inflate the headers a reader has to walk. |
| row group size | 1,048,576 rows | Shared with the Vortex side as `GPU_ROW_GROUP_SIZE` — see below. |

### Matching physical partitions

A Parquet row group and a Vortex chunk are the same thing for this comparison: the unit the
reader plans and dispatches over. Both formats are pinned to `GPU_ROW_GROUP_SIZE`
(1,048,576 rows, Parquet's `DEFAULT_MAX_ROW_GROUP_ROW_COUNT`).

Without this the two are not comparable. Parquet reads ~1M-row row groups, while the Vortex
side inherits the Arrow reader's ~8K-row batches — each of which becomes its own chunk, its own
compressed blocks and its own kernel launches, so a single dispatch turns into hundreds.

Setting the Arrow reader's batch size alone is not enough: the reader also breaks at the source
file's row group boundaries, so short batches survive. `parquet_to_vortex_chunks_with_batch_size`
therefore concatenates the source batches and re-slices them on exact boundaries. Those batches
are written straight through as root chunks via `ChunkedLayoutStrategy`, and read back with
`SplitBy::RowCount(GPU_ROW_GROUP_SIZE)` so a scan batch is one whole partition.

### Correctness

`--gpu-verify` cross-checks device output against the CPU decoders on every iteration:

- Parquet: the cuDF-read frame is compared against a CPU Parquet read of the same file.
- Vortex: each GPU-decoded field is copied back and compared against the same field decoded
  on the CPU, through Arrow with a pinned target type.

The check runs before each timed measurement and is not included in it, so a verifying run
still publishes comparable numbers — it just takes considerably longer:

```bash
cargo run -p compress-bench --profile release_debug \
  --features cuda,unstable_encodings -- --gpu-decompress --gpu-verify --iterations 1
```

Any `--gpu-decompress` run reports on every dataset rather than stopping at the first failure, so
one run shows which datasets decode correctly on the GPU and which do not. The timing tables are
rendered before the failure summary, so a dataset the GPU cannot decode still leaves the rest of
the matrix with numbers — the process exits non-zero either way.

The dataset list in `src/main.rs` therefore holds only datasets a `--gpu-verify` run has confirmed.
It now covers the whole compress suite: the kernel gaps that kept `taxi`, `Arade`, `CMSprovider`,
`Euro2016`, `HashTags` and the `StructListOfInts` wide tables off it — `u16` components in
`date_time_parts`, per-element `RunEnd` validity, and missing `vortex.masked` and `vortex.list`
kernels — have since been closed. Add a new dataset there once verification passes.

`airquality` and `rplace` download from pcodec's public bucket, which the CPU suite skips to avoid
creating egress charges for pcodec. The GPU suite runs every entry on its explicit list, so both
are fetched on each GPU run.
