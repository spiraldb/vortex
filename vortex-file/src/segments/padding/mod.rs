///
/// ## Why this is a trade-off
///
/// Block alignment does not make direct I/O possible — a reader can always widen an unaligned
/// request out to the enclosing blocks and slice the result — it only removes the widening. That
/// saves at most one block of over-read per *physical* read, while padding costs up to one block
/// per *segment*. Because reads are coalesced across many segments, aligning every segment
/// usually costs far more bytes than it saves.
