/// It is important to understand the semantics of the read futures returned by a [`FileSegmentSource`].
/// Under the hood, each instance is backed by a stream that services read requests by
/// applying coalescing and concurrency constraints.
///
/// Each read future has four states:
/// * `registered` - the read future has been created, but not yet polled.
/// * `requested` - the read future has been polled.
/// * `in-flight` - the read request has been sent to the underlying storage system.
/// * `resolved` - the read future has completed and resolved a result.
///
/// When a read request is `registered`, it will not itself trigger any I/O, but is eligible to
/// be coalesced with other requests.
///
/// If a read future is dropped, it will be canceled if possible. This depends on the current
/// state of the request, as well as whether the underlying storage system supports cancellation.
///

/// other registered requests are lumped together into a single I/O operation.
/// A cloneable handle to the background read driver, shared by every in-flight [`ReadFuture`].
///
/// [`Shared`] fans a single completion out to all readers with correct waker bookkeeping, so a
/// reader is always woken when the driver finishes — even if another reader polled the driver more
/// recently and was then dropped. Its output is `()`; a driver panic is carried out of band in
/// [`DriverPanic`] so it can be re-raised on the reader side.
