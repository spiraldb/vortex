//! The Vortex Scan API implements an abstract table scan interface that can be used to
//! read data from various data sources.
//!
//! It supports arbitrary projection expressions, filter expressions, and limit pushdown as well
//! as mechanisms for parallel and distributed execution via partitions.
//!
//! The API is currently under development and may change in future releases, however we hope to
//! stabilize into stable C ABI for use within foreign language bindings.
//!
//! If you are looking to scan Vortex files or layouts, the Vortex implementation of the Scan API
//! can be found in the `vortex-layout` crate.
//!
//! ## Open Issues
//!
//! * We probably want to make the DataSource serializable as well, so that we can share
//!   source-level state with workers, separately from partition serialization.
//! * We should add a way for the client to negotiate capabilities with the data source, for
//!   example which encodings it knows about.
