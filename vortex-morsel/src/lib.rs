//! An experimental morsel-driven scan executor for Vortex layouts.
//!
//! This crate is the P1 spine of the design recorded in
//! `docs/developer-guide/internals/scan-execution-models/morsel-based-plan-execution.md`: the scan
//! is cut into *morsels* (contiguous root row ranges), and each morsel is driven by a tree of
//! stateful [`ExecNode`] state machines that pull values from their children.
//!
//! The two halves of the contract are:
//!
//! * [`ExecNode::next_plan`] — planning. A node *names* the IO it will need by registering
//!   [`IoUse`](io::IoUse)s against the [`IoPlane`](io::IoPlane), which hands back tickets. Nodes
//!   do not read during planning. Planning is budget-bounded and resumable: a node that exhausts
//!   its quantum yields [`PlanItem::Plan`] and resumes from its own cursor on the next call.
//! * [`ExecNode::execute`] — value production. When a named required cell is still unissued,
//!   [`ExecCx::ready`](node::ExecCx::ready) may attempt one caller-provided probe guaranteed not
//!   to wait on storage (Linux files use `preadv2(RWF_NOWAIT)`). A hit is consumed inline. A
//!   miss hands the read out as required demand and waits on the exact ticket; the owning worker
//!   resumes the same morsel once it is completed.
//!
//! Compared to the V1 `LayoutReader` path this executor differs in two measurable ways:
//!
//! 1. There is no async task per evaluation. Planning and execution stay on the affinity-owned
//!    worker, which parks while its exact reads are outstanding; a blocked worker cannot execute
//!    another morsel.
//! 2. Each worker owns one arena and one active morsel. Arenas never migrate, and emission order
//!    is restored by morsel index.
//!
//! The executor never touches storage. Reads it wants started leave a [`MorselScan`] as
//! [`IoDemand`](io::IoDemand) on a stream taken with [`MorselScan::take_io`], and whoever owns
//! storage answers them through [`IoCompletions`](io::IoCompletions); a blocked worker parks on
//! its exact cells until they are completed. [`SegmentSourceDriver`] serves that demand from any
//! [`SegmentSource`](vortex_layout::segments::SegmentSource) as one task on the caller's runtime.
//!
//! Raw request cells are shared for the lifetime of a scan, deduplicating both pending and
//! completed segment reads. Decoded chunks use leased shared cells ([`cells::SharedCells`]): a
//! decoded chunk lives exactly while some not-yet-retired morsel holds a lease computed from the
//! morsel cut, and is dropped at the last release. Decoded sharing can be disabled independently
//! as a differential-test and benchmark mode.
//!
//! Only the FLAT, CHUNKED and STRUCT layout nodes are supported, plus the FILTER and
//! CONJUNCT operators. Anything else is rejected at build time by [`build::build_plan`].
