## Overview

Vortex is a next-generation columnar file format and toolkit designed for high-performance data processing.
It is the fastest and most extensible format for building data systems backed by object storage. It provides:

- **Blazing Fast Performance**
  - 100x faster random access reads (vs. modern Apache Parquet)
  - 10-20x faster scans
  - 5x faster writes
  - Similar compression ratios
  - Efficient support for wide tables with zero-copy/zero-parse metadata

- **Extensible Architecture**
  - Modeled after Apache DataFusion's extensible approach
  - Pluggable encoding system, type system, compression strategy, & layout strategy
  - Zero-copy compatibility with Apache Arrow

- **Open Source, Neutral Governance**
  - A Linux Foundation (LF AI & Data) Project
  - Apache-2.0 Licensed

- **Integrations**
  - Arrow, DataFusion, DuckDB, Spark, Pandas, Polars, & more
  - Apache Iceberg (coming soon)

> 🟢 **Development Status**: Library APIs may change from version to version, but we now consider
> the file format <ins>_stable_</ins>. From release 0.36.0, all future releases of Vortex should
> maintain backwards compatibility of the file format (i.e., be able to read files written by
> any earlier version >= 0.36.0).

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Logical Types** - Clean separation between logical schema and physical layout
- **Zero-Copy Arrow Integration** - Seamless conversion to/from Apache Arrow arrays
- **Extensible Encodings** - Pluggable physical layouts with built-in optimizations
- **Cascading Compression** - Support for nested encoding schemes
- **High-Performance Computing** - Optimized compute kernels for encoded data
- **Rich Statistics** - Lazy-loaded summary statistics for optimization

### Technical Architecture

#### Logical vs Physical Design

Vortex strictly separates logical and physical concerns:

- **Logical Layer**: Defines data types and schema
- **Physical Layer**: Handles encoding and storage implementation
- **Built-in Encodings**: Compatible with Apache Arrow's memory format
- **Extension Encodings**: Optimized compression schemes (RLE, dictionary, etc.)

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Rust Crate

All features are exported through the main `vortex` crate.

```bash
cargo add vortex
```

#### Python Package

```bash
uv add vortex-data
```

#### Command Line UI (vx)

For browsing the structure of Vortex files, you can use the `vx` command-line tool.

```bash
# Install pre-built binary (fast, recommended)
cargo binstall vortex-tui

# Or build from source
cargo install vortex-tui --locked

# Or run via Python without installing
uvx --from vortex-data vx --help

# Usage
vx browse <file>
```

### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites (macOS)

```bash
# Optional but recommended dependencies
brew install flatbuffers protobuf  # For .fbs and .proto files
brew install duckdb               # For benchmarks

# Install Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# or
brew install rustup

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Setup dependencies with uv
uv sync --all-packages
```

See the [development workflows](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-workflows) for Python binding and
documentation development, including Maturin rebuilds, targeted tests, and documentation checks.

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain used for development and CI, and is kept on the latest
stable release. Building Vortex as a dependency only requires a toolchain that satisfies the
[Rust version compatibility policy](#rust-version-compatibility-policy).

### Benchmarking

Use `vx-bench` to run benchmarks comparing engines (DataFusion, DuckDB) and formats (Parquet, Vortex):

```bash
# Install the benchmark orchestrator
uv tool install "bench_orchestrator @ ./bench-orchestrator/"

# Run TPC-H benchmarks
vx-bench run tpch --engine datafusion,duckdb --format parquet,vortex

# Compare results
vx-bench compare --run latest
```

See [bench-orchestrator/README.md](bench-orchestrator/README.md) for full documentation.

### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance, we suggest using [MiMalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc):

```rust,ignore
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL_ALLOC: MiMalloc = MiMalloc;
```

## Project Information

### Rust Version Compatibility Policy

**The policy: Vortex supports the four most recent stable minor releases.** Writing the latest
stable release as `1.N`, that means `1.N`, `1.N-1`, `1.N-2`, and `1.N-3` all build Vortex, so the
three minor releases older than the latest stable release. Only the minor version is constrained;
Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) declared in `Cargo.toml` must be **no newer than `1.N-3`**,
patch releases are never a factor.

An MSRV *older* than `1.N-3` is always acceptable — supporting extra releases cannot break the
guarantee. An MSRV *newer* than `1.N-3` does not meet the policy. For example, once `1.98` is the
latest stable release:

| Declared MSRV | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `1.94` or older | Acceptable — supports more releases than required |
| `1.95` | Exactly on policy |
| `1.96` or newer | Does not meet the policy |

The MSRV is raised in occasional deliberate steps rather than on every Rust release, so it drifts
relative to that bound.

How the policy is applied:

- The MSRV is declared once, as `rust-version` in the root `Cargo.toml`, and inherited by every
  crate in the workspace. That value, not this document, is the source of truth.
- The toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` tracks the latest stable release and is independent
  of the MSRV. It is what contributors and most CI jobs build with.
- CI enforces the declared MSRV in the `Rust (MSRV)` job, which builds the publishable crates with
  exactly that toolchain. When it fails, the first choices are to express the code without the
  newer Rust feature, or to hold back the dependency update that raised the requirement. Raising
  `rust-version` is a last resort.
