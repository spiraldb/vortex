//! An experimental morsel-driven scan executor for Vortex layouts.
//!
//! This crate is the P1 spine of the design recorded in
//! `docs/developer-guide/internals/scan-execution-models/morsel-based-plan-execution.md`: the scan
//! is cut into *morsels* (contiguous root row ranges), and each morsel is driven by a tree of
//! stateful [`ExecNode`] state machines. [`ExecutionMode::Pull`] is the recursive oracle;
//! [`ExecutionMode::Push`] activates leaves and routes batches upward through credited edges.
//!
//! The shared planning contract and two value-execution contracts are:
//!
//! * [`ExecNode::next_plan`] — planning. A node *names* the IO it will need by registering
//!   [`IoUse`](io::IoUse)s against the [`IoPlane`](io::IoPlane), which hands back tickets. Nodes
//!   do not read during planning. Planning is budget-bounded and resumable: a node that exhausts
//!   its quantum yields [`PlanItem::Plan`] and resumes from its own cursor on the next call.
//! * [`ExecNode::execute`] — value production. When a named required cell is still unissued,
//!   [`ExecCx::ready`](node::ExecCx::ready) may attempt one source-provided read guaranteed not to
//!   wait on storage (Linux files use `preadv2(RWF_NOWAIT)`). A hit is consumed inline. A miss
//!   hands the read out as required demand and suspends on the exact ticket. Execution never
//!   polls a storage future or waits for IO on the worker thread.
//! * Typed [`ExecNode`] push methods — leaf-driven value production through compiled physical
//!   pipelines on the owning worker. Authoritative [`ActivationTarget`] decisions are distinct
//!   from optional [`DemandTarget`] I/O hints.
//!
//! Compared to the V1 `LayoutReader` path this executor differs in two measurable ways:
//!
//! 1. There is no async task per evaluation. Planning and execution continuations share one
//!    bounded worker pool. The executor never touches storage: reads leave a [`MorselScan`] as
//!    [`IoDemand`](io::IoDemand) on a stream taken with [`MorselScan::take_io`] and are answered
//!    through [`IoCompletions`](io::IoCompletions), for example by [`SegmentSourceDriver`].
//! 2. Each worker owns one arena and one active morsel. Arenas never migrate, and emission order
//!    is restored by morsel index.
//! 3. [`MorselScan::into_stream`] exposes ordered bounded output with explicit cancellation;
//!    [`MorselScan::run`] remains the collecting adapter.
//!
//! Raw request cells are shared for the lifetime of a scan, deduplicating both pending and
//! completed segment reads. Decoded chunks use leased shared cells ([`cells::SharedCells`]): a
//! decoded chunk lives exactly while some not-yet-retired morsel holds a lease computed from the
//! morsel cut, and is dropped at the last release. Decoded sharing can be disabled independently
//! as a differential-test and benchmark mode.
//!
//! Only the FLAT, CHUNKED and STRUCT layout nodes are supported, plus the FILTER and
//! CONJUNCT operators. Anything else is rejected at build time by [`build::build_plan`].
